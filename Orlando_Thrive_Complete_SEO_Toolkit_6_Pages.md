# Couples Therapy in Orlando, FL

Every relationship has rough patches. When communication breaks down, trust erodes, or you simply feel disconnected from your partner, it's easy to wonder if things can ever improve. They can. At Orlando Thrive Therapy, our couples therapists have helped hundreds of Orlando partners rebuild their relationships and rediscover why they chose each other in the first place.

Seeking help isn't a sign your relationship is failing. It's a sign you care enough to fight for it.

## Signs You Could Benefit from Couples Therapy

You don't need to be in crisis to benefit from professional support. Many couples seek therapy to strengthen an already good relationship or address issues before they become serious problems.

Consider couples therapy if you're experiencing:

**Communication breakdowns** where conversations quickly turn into arguments, or you've stopped talking about anything meaningful altogether. You might feel like you're speaking different languages.

**The same arguments on repeat** without ever reaching resolution. You know exactly how the fight will go before it even starts, and neither of you feels heard.

**Emotional distance** that's grown over time. You live together but feel alone. The intimacy and connection you once shared has faded into routine.

**Trust concerns** from past hurts, dishonesty, or infidelity. Rebuilding trust requires more than promises—it takes structured work with professional guidance.

**Major life transitions** like having children, job changes, health issues, or caring for aging parents. These stressors can strain even the strongest partnerships.

**Uncertainty about your future together** and whether you're still compatible. Sometimes you need an outside perspective to see your relationship clearly.

## Our Approach: Gottman Method Couples Therapy

Orlando Thrive Therapy uses the Gottman Method, one of the most researched and effective approaches to couples therapy available today. Developed by Drs. John and Julie Gottman over 40 years of studying thousands of couples, this method is based on what actually works in real relationships.

### The Four Horsemen

Dr. Gottman identified four communication patterns that predict relationship failure with over 90% accuracy:

**Criticism** - Attacking your partner's character rather than addressing specific behaviors

**Contempt** - Expressing disgust or superiority through sarcasm, eye-rolling, or mockery

**Defensiveness** - Deflecting responsibility and making excuses instead of listening

**Stonewalling** - Withdrawing from interaction and shutting down completely

Our therapists help you recognize these patterns in your relationship and replace them with healthier alternatives.

### Building Your Sound Relationship House

The Gottman Method focuses on strengthening the friendship at the core of your relationship. You'll learn to:

- Build love maps by staying curious about your partner's inner world
- Share fondness and admiration through regular expressions of appreciation
- Turn toward each other instead of away during everyday moments
- Manage conflict productively without damaging your bond
- Make life dreams come true by supporting each other's goals
- Create shared meaning through rituals, values, and symbols unique to your relationship

## What to Expect in Couples Therapy

### Your First Session

Your initial appointment focuses on understanding your relationship history and current challenges. Both partners will share their perspectives in a structured way that ensures everyone feels heard. Your therapist will identify patterns, strengths, and areas needing attention.

Many couples feel relief after the first session simply from having a neutral third party validate their experiences and provide hope for improvement.

### Ongoing Sessions

Therapy sessions typically last 50-90 minutes, depending on what you're working on. You'll learn practical skills during sessions and practice them at home between appointments. Progress happens both in the therapy room and in your daily interactions.

Your therapist may occasionally meet with each partner individually to gain deeper understanding of personal perspectives and history that affect the relationship.

### Between Sessions

Couples therapy works best when you apply what you learn. Your therapist will give you specific exercises, conversation starters, or practices to try at home. These aren't busywork—they're essential to creating lasting change.

## Four Convenient Orlando Locations

We make it easy to prioritize your relationship with four therapy offices across Central Florida:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does couples therapy work?

Couples therapy involves both partners meeting with a licensed therapist to work on relationship issues. Sessions typically last 50-90 minutes and focus on improving communication, resolving conflicts, and rebuilding connection. Your therapist guides conversations and teaches practical skills you can use between sessions.

### How long does couples therapy take?

Most couples attend therapy for 12-20 sessions, though this varies based on the issues being addressed. Some couples see improvement in just a few sessions, while others benefit from longer-term support. Your therapist will discuss a recommended timeline based on your specific situation.

### What issues can couples therapy help with?

Couples therapy helps with communication problems, trust issues, infidelity recovery, frequent arguments, emotional distance, intimacy concerns, major life transitions, parenting disagreements, and pre-marital preparation. If something is affecting your relationship, therapy can help.

# Marriage Counseling in Orlando, FL

Every marriage faces challenges. Whether you're dealing with communication breakdowns, trust issues, or simply feeling disconnected from your spouse, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. At Orlando Thrive Therapy, our licensed marriage counselors have helped hundreds of Orlando couples rebuild their relationships and rediscover the connection that brought them together.

## When to Consider Marriage Counseling

Many couples wait too long before seeking help. Research shows that the average couple waits six years after problems begin before attending their first counseling session. By then, negative patterns have often become deeply ingrained.

Consider marriage counseling if you're experiencing:

**Communication problems** that lead to frequent arguments or complete shutdown. You may find yourselves having the same fights repeatedly without resolution, or avoiding difficult conversations altogether.

**Trust issues** stemming from infidelity, dishonesty, or broken promises. Rebuilding trust takes time and professional guidance to navigate the complex emotions involved.

**Emotional distance** where you feel more like roommates than romantic partners. The intimacy and connection you once shared has faded, leaving both partners feeling lonely within the marriage.

**Major life transitions** such as having children, job changes, relocations, or caring for aging parents. These stressors can strain even strong marriages.

**Different goals or values** that have emerged over time. People grow and change, and sometimes couples find themselves wanting different things from life.

## Our Approach to Marriage Counseling

Orlando Thrive Therapy uses evidence-based approaches proven to help couples heal and grow. Our marriage counselors are trained in Gottman Method Couples Therapy, which draws on over 40 years of research on what makes relationships succeed or fail.

### What to Expect in Your First Session

Your initial session focuses on understanding your relationship history and current challenges. Both partners will have the opportunity to share their perspective in a safe, non-judgmental environment. Your therapist will assess the strengths in your relationship as well as the areas needing attention.

We'll discuss your goals for counseling and create a treatment plan tailored to your specific situation. Some couples need help with a specific issue, while others benefit from a more comprehensive approach to strengthening their overall relationship.

### Building Skills That Last

Marriage counseling isn't just about solving immediate problems. It's about building skills you'll use for the rest of your lives together. Our therapists teach couples how to:

**Communicate effectively** without criticism, contempt, defensiveness, or stonewalling—the four behaviors researcher John Gottman identified as most destructive to relationships.

**Manage conflict productively** because disagreements are inevitable in any relationship. The goal isn't to eliminate conflict but to handle it in ways that don't damage your bond.

**Rebuild and maintain trust** through consistent actions, transparency, and accountability. Trust is rebuilt one small moment at a time.

**Deepen emotional intimacy** by learning to turn toward each other during both good times and bad. Small daily moments of connection matter more than grand gestures.

**Navigate difficult decisions together** as a team, even when you have different opinions or preferences.

## Why Choose Orlando Thrive Therapy

### Experienced, Licensed Therapists

Our marriage counselors hold advanced degrees and specialized training in couples therapy. They've helped couples facing every type of challenge, from everyday communication issues to recovery from affairs.

### Certified Gottman Therapists

Several of our therapists are certified in Gottman Method Couples Therapy, one of the most researched and effective approaches to marriage counseling available today.

### Four Convenient Locations

## Common Questions About Marriage Counseling

### How long does marriage counseling take to work?

Most couples begin seeing improvements within 8-12 sessions. However, the timeline depends on the specific issues being addressed and both partners' commitment to the process. Some couples benefit from ongoing maintenance sessions after initial progress.

### What if my spouse doesn't want to attend marriage counseling?

Individual therapy can still benefit your marriage. Working with a therapist on your own can help you develop better communication skills, understand relationship patterns, and create positive changes that often encourage a reluctant partner to eventually participate.

### How much does marriage counseling cost in Orlando?

Session rates vary based on therapist experience and session length. Many insurance plans cover marriage counseling. Contact our office at (407) 592-8997 to discuss rates and verify your insurance benefits.

### What's the difference between marriage counseling and couples therapy?

The terms are often used interchangeably. Marriage counseling typically focuses on married couples, while couples therapy can include any committed relationship. At Orlando Thrive Therapy, we work with both married couples and committed partners using similar evidence-based approaches.

### Is what we discuss confidential?

Yes. Everything discussed in marriage counseling is confidential and protected by law. There are very limited exceptions, such as if there's a risk of harm to yourself or others. Your therapist will explain confidentiality in detail during your first session.

## Take the First Step Today

Reaching out for help can feel vulnerable, but it's often the turning point that saves a marriage. Our compassionate therapists create a safe space where both partners feel heard and respected.

You don't have to have all the answers before calling. You don't even have to be certain counseling will work. You just have to be willing to try.

**Call (407) 592-8997** to schedule your first marriage counseling session, or contact us online to request an appointment. We'll match you with a therapist who specializes in the issues you're facing.

Your marriage is worth fighting for. Let us help you find your way back to each other.

## Therapy Services in Winter Park

Our Winter Park therapists specialize in a range of mental health concerns. Whatever you're facing, we have a counselor with the expertise to help.

### Couples Therapy & Marriage Counseling

Relationships take work, and sometimes couples need professional support to navigate challenges. Our Gottman-trained therapists help partners improve communication, rebuild trust, and reconnect emotionally. Whether you're dealing with frequent arguments, emotional distance, or recovering from infidelity, we're here to help.

### Individual Therapy

Life doesn't always go as planned. Individual therapy provides a confidential space to process difficult emotions, develop coping strategies, and work toward personal growth. Our therapists help with depression, life transitions, self-esteem, grief, and finding direction when you feel stuck.

### Anxiety Treatment

Anxiety affects millions of adults, and Winter Park's high-achieving community is no exception. Racing thoughts, constant worry, difficulty sleeping, and physical symptoms like chest tightness can significantly impact your quality of life. Our therapists use proven techniques including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help you manage anxiety effectively.

### EMDR Therapy

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a powerful therapy for trauma, PTSD, and disturbing memories that continue to affect your present life. EMDR helps your brain process traumatic experiences so they no longer trigger intense emotional reactions.

### Women's Therapy

Women face unique challenges throughout different life stages. From career pressures and relationship stress to motherhood, hormonal changes, and identity shifts, our female therapists understand the complexities women navigate.

### Life Coaching

Sometimes you don't need therapy for a mental health diagnosis—you need guidance, accountability, and support to reach your goals. Our life coaches help with career decisions, personal development, work-life balance, and creating the life you want.

# Therapist in Altamonte Springs, FL

Altamonte Springs sits at a crossroads—geographically between Orlando and the northern suburbs, and often in the lives of residents balancing work, family, and personal wellbeing. At Orlando Thrive Therapy's Altamonte Springs location, we provide professional counseling services for individuals and couples navigating life's challenges.

Whether you're commuting from Longwood, Lake Mary, or Casselberry, our convenient location makes quality therapy accessible.

## Our Altamonte Springs Office

**Address:** 940 Centre Cir Suite 1012, Altamonte Springs, FL 32714

**Phone:** (407) 592-8997

**Hours:**
- Monday – Friday: 8 AM – 9 PM
- Saturday – Sunday: 9 AM – 4 PM

## Therapy Services in Altamonte Springs

### Couples Therapy & Marriage Counseling

Relationship challenges don't discriminate by zip code. Our Gottman-trained therapists help Altamonte Springs couples improve communication, resolve recurring conflicts, and rebuild emotional connection. Whether you're newlyweds adjusting to married life or long-term partners who've grown apart, we can help.

### Individual Therapy

Life in the suburbs comes with its own pressures: long commutes, demanding jobs, raising children, and sometimes feeling isolated despite being surrounded by people. Individual therapy provides a confidential space to process emotions, develop coping strategies, and work toward the life you want.

### Anxiety Treatment

Worry that won't stop. Difficulty sleeping. A constant feeling that something bad is about to happen. Anxiety affects people across all walks of life, and our Altamonte Springs therapists specialize in evidence-based treatments that actually work.

### EMDR Therapy

Trauma doesn't have to control your life forever. EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) helps your brain process difficult memories so they no longer trigger overwhelming emotions. Our certified EMDR therapists have helped clients heal from accidents, abuse, loss, and other traumatic experiences.

### Women's Therapy

Women often carry invisible burdens: caretaking for children and aging parents, managing households while building careers, and losing themselves in the process. Our female therapists create a space where women can explore these challenges without judgment.

### Life Coaching

Sometimes you don't need therapy—you need direction. Our life coaches help with career transitions, goal setting, work-life balance, and creating a roadmap for the future you want.

## Therapy Services in Downtown Orlando

### Couples Therapy & Marriage Counseling

Downtown Orlando attracts driven, ambitious people—which often means two demanding careers under one roof. Our Gottman-trained therapists help couples balance individual goals with relationship health, improving communication and rebuilding connection even in the midst of busy lives.

### Individual Therapy

The pace of urban life can be exhilarating, but it can also be isolating. Individual therapy provides a confidential space to process stress, anxiety, depression, life transitions, and the existential questions that arise when you finally slow down long enough to think.

### Anxiety Treatment

Career pressure, social expectations, financial stress, and the constant stimulation of city life all contribute to anxiety. Our Downtown Orlando therapists specialize in evidence-based treatments that help you manage worry, physical symptoms, and the racing thoughts that won't let you rest.

### EMDR Therapy

Trauma doesn't care about your success or your ZIP code. EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) helps your brain process difficult experiences so they no longer control your present. Our certified EMDR therapists have helped clients heal from a wide range of traumatic experiences.

### Women's Therapy

Women in Downtown Orlando often balance high-powered careers with relationships, family planning decisions, and societal pressures. Our female therapists understand these unique challenges and provide a supportive space for exploration and growth.

### Life Coaching

Sometimes you don't need therapy—you need strategy. Our life coaches work with professionals on career development, leadership skills, work-life balance, and achieving goals that feel just out of reach.
